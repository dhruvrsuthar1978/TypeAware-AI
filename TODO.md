# TypeAware AI ML Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies
- [ ] Update ai/requirements.txt with additional ML libraries (transformers, torch, joblib, imbalanced-learn)
- [ ] Create ai/datasets/ directory structure
- [ ] Create ai/models/ directory structure
- [ ] Create ai/training/ directory structure

## Phase 2: Dataset Creation
- [ ] Create ai/datasets/cyberbullying_dataset.py - Generate synthetic and curated cyberbullying datasets
- [ ] Create ai/datasets/data_loader.py - Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- [ ] Generate labeled datasets for all categories (harassment, hate_speech, spam, threats, cyberbullying, sexual_harassment)
- [ ] Create balanced training/validation/test splits

## Phase 3: ML Model Development
- [x] Create ai/detection/ml_detection_engine.py - ML-based detection engine
- [x] Create ai/models/model_manager.py - Model serialization and loading utilities
- [x] Implement multiple classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- [x] Add feature extraction (TF-IDF, n-grams, text statistics)

## Phase 4: Training Pipeline
- [ ] Create ai/training/train_classifiers.py - Training scripts for each category
- [ ] Create ai/training/evaluate_models.py - Model evaluation and metrics
- [ ] Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Train models for each abuse category

## Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] Modify ai/detection/content_detection_engine.py - Add ML component integration
- [ ] Modify ai/main_engine.py - Integrate ML models with existing rule-based system
- [ ] Implement hybrid scoring (rule-based + ML ensemble)
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms when ML models unavailable

## Phase 6: API Updates
- [ ] Modify ai/integration/api_interface.py - Add ML-specific endpoints
- [ ] Add endpoints for model status, performance metrics, dataset statistics
- [ ] Update existing analysis endpoints to use hybrid system

## Phase 7: Testing and Evaluation
- [ ] Test hybrid detection system performance
- [ ] Compare ML vs rule-based accuracy
- [ ] Add model monitoring and drift detection
- [ ] Create evaluation scripts and benchmarks

## Phase 8: Advanced Moderation Features
- [ ] Implement escalating penalty system (warnings → temporary blocks → permanent bans)
- [ ] Add shadow-banning functionality for problematic users
- [ ] Create time-based user restriction system
- [ ] Enhance rephrasing suggestions with contextual AI responses
- [ ] Add educational messaging for user behavior improvement

## Phase 9: Privacy & Compliance
- [ ] Implement anonymous tracking mechanisms
- [ ] Add GDPR compliance features and data handling
- [ ] Create privacy-focused user data management
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

## Phase 10: Cross-platform Integration
- [ ] Develop platform-specific API adapters (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- [ ] Create integration documentation for social media platforms
- [ ] Add platform-specific content parsing and normalization

## Phase 11: Production Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Complete deployment scripts and configurations
- [ ] Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Update documentation and setup configurations
